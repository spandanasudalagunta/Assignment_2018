Title: Solution for Problem 4 given below, 

How will you modify the model if there is a fixed cost of $1,000 for each month that there is production? This cost is assumed only if there is production different from zero in that month.
----------------------


```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
x <- read.lp("PP4_Constraints.lp")
x

```

now, solve the problem
```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective(x)

```
get variables and contranints 
```{r}
get.constraints(x)
```

get variables
```{r}
get.variables(x)
```
